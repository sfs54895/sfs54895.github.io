Hi My name is Sidney Szerlip. I am from Dallas, Texas and am majoring in 
Marketing and Fashion Merchandising. I hope to one day be the CEO of Gucci.
This summer I am planning on studying abroad in Rome to meet people that can
help me make my way into the fashion world. 
I have one younger sister named Max and two older brothers named David and Aaron. 
Aaron has a daughter named Aria and is wife is currently pregnant with another baby.
David has a son named Jake and just had twin baby girls named Emma and Sophia.
My parents are divorced but when I was in highschool, I spent weekends with my dad and
weekdays with my mom. My mom has a boyfriend named Travis who is super cool. He also went to 
UGA and has a son named Carter who just applied.
